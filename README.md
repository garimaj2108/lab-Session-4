This data set provides the list of Top Universities for MS in MIS in USA and the program that they offer. 


How I derived this data:
I decided to use MSIS graduate school data from different schools. It was a really difficult task, as there was hardly any data available for Masters program. I scoured different data sources and finally cleaned the data to obtain rankings for MSIS program, student to teacher ratio among different universities and acceptance rates of universities to reflect why SCU would be a good choice. 
Hiccups: It took me about 5-6 hours to scour the data, as a lot of times data wasn't useful or if I tried web scraping I hit the wall because the websites were blocking web scrapers. Finding meaningful data was truly challenging in the context of my understanding for the data research.

WARRANT:
Santa Clara University has the highest acceptance rate compared to its counterparts, it has comparable ratings to other top-tier universities like UC Berkeley, it is located in Silicon Valley which is The Tech hub and offers great personal attention to students as its student teacher ratio is great. Joining SCU will equip you to excel not only in studies but also offer maximum opportunities for finding a job.

RESERVATION: 
Have to find job placement rates and average salary comparison in Bay area to other cities in USA, to make a compelling claim.
